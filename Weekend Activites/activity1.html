     <h1 style="color:#ffffff" >Metaphor</h1>
    <p>A metaphor is a mapping from one domain to another. For <br>
        example, moo is to cow as beep is to car. These mappings<br> get so buried in our language that we don't even notice their<br> effects.</p>
    <p>For example, take the language used to describe a debate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"He shot down her ideas."</li>
        <li>"She defended her position."</li>
        <li>"She overwhelmed his arguments."</li>
        <li>"He had to retreat from that position."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are all debate-as-war metaphors. It's a zero sum game. <br>
        Someone wins and someone loses. The idea that both people <br>could learn from each other just doesn't come up.</p>
